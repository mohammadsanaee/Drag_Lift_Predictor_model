How to use the model?  
As the input parameters are explained in the paper:

After running the python file the system automatically gets the 7 inputs ( C (chord length), b (airfoil semi span), A/C (protuberanceamplitude to Chord length), Î»/C (protuberance wavelength to Chord length), h/c (Submergence depth to Chord length), Alpha (Angle of Attack) and Re (Reynolds Number)) and generates the  
drag and lift coefficients.
